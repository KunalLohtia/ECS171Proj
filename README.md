# How to Run the Program

First make sure the following pkl files have been generated by running the relu.py, annsig.py, and logistic_regression.py :
```
1. relu.pkl
2. annsig.pkl
3. logistic.pkl
```

From there, you can then run app.py to run the website

# Test Cases

**Test Case 1 (Tumor 19 in the dataset):** 

It should output Benign for all three models
